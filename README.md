## Introduction to Number Theory

This repository includes all my programs for the course Introduction to Number Theory 2020 at the University of Copenhagen, Department of Mathematical Sciences.

Contents:

* The Euclidean Algorithm (simple and extended with Bezout's lemma)
* Euler's phi-function (brute force and using prime factorization)
* Primality testing and prime factorization
* The Sieve of Erastothenes
* Carmichael numbers
* Solving modular linear equations
* The Chinese Remainder Theorem
* Quadratic residues
* The theorem of Quadratic reciprocity
* Continued fractions

Results used in the algorithms can be found in the Course notes "Introduction to
Number Theory" by Morten S. Risager. The notes can (when the site works) be found [here](https://web.math.ku.dk/~risager/introtal/main.pdf).
    
CLRS refers to the book "Introduction to Algorithms" by Cormen, Leiserson,
Rivest and Stein.
